# React-p5 Interface Module
A modular React component designed to bridge the gap between UI state and p5.js canvas logic. Built as part of my **GSoC 2026** preparation.

## ✨ Highlights
- **State-Driven UI:** Using React hooks to control animation states.
- **Component Architecture:** Separating display logic from control logic.
- **Accessibility:** Integrated ARIA labels for inclusive user experience.

## 🚀 Future Goals
- Integration with the p5.js Web Editor codebase.
- Implementing dynamic parameter control for sketches.
